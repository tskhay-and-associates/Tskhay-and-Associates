    'I started Tskhay & Associates because I was tired of seeing brilliant HR leaders and business executives get stuck with ambiguous, theoretical strategies that fail in the real world. It is incredibly frustrating to spend immense time and money building these plans, only to watch them collect dust. You deserve practical, actionable solutions that actually make a difference for your workforce and your bottom line.',

Some of the programs I built improved retention from 56% to 87% in 18 months and moved eNPS from −17 to +20. I hold a Ph.D. in Quantitative Psychology from the University of Toronto and have spent over a decade advising organizations—from fast-growing start-ups to Fortune 500s—on how to use data to drive retention, engagement, and performance.',
